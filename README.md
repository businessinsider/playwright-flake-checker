## Overview

Playwright Flake Checker is a tool designed to help developers identify, analyze, and manage flaky tests in Playwright-based test suites. Flaky tests are tests that sometimes pass and sometimes fail without any changes to the code, making them difficult to diagnose and fix. This tool provides utilities to run, monitor, and report on flaky tests, improving the reliability of your test suite.
